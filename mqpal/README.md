Main Functionalities
 - Users will be able to view an interactive map of the MQU campus
 - Users will be able to submit inquiries regarding their experiences on campus
 - Users will be able to edit, delete, and update their inquiries
 - Users will be able to switch the theme between dark mode and light mode
 - Inquiries are saved into cloud storage through Firebase Storage API
 - 

Differences since original design:
 - CHANGED -> The inquiry submission form is now a pop-up form instead of a whole new page. This is done to prevent overwhelming the user with too many pages.
 - ADDED -> Interactive campus map
 - ADDED -> Dark Mode
 - REMOVED -> Coffee subsystem. Realised the application would make more sense with just a map and an inquiries subsystem.

Devices used to develop:
 - Large Android
 - iPhone 14
 - ... 

TO-DO:
 - Implement UPDATE for inquiries
 - Implement DELETE for inquiries
 - Implement error feedbacks for issues (e.g. no internet when deleting inquiry)
